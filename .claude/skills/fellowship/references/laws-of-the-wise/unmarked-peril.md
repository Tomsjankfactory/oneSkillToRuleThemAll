# Law of the Wise: Unmarked Peril

Do not execute tasks without first classifying them through the threat levels framework.

**Symptoms:**
- Tasks proceed without stated risk tier or required controls.
- No rollback notes, verification evidence, or Palantir review where warranted.
- High-risk changes ship with the same controls as routine patches.

**Remedy:** Classify every task against the threat tiers in `references/threat-levels.md` before execution begins. Apply the minimum required controls for the assigned tier.
