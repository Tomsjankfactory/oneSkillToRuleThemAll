# Law of the Wise: One Ring, Two Bearers

Do not assign the same file to multiple Quest Leaders.

**Symptoms:**
- Quest Leaders overwrite each other's changes.
- Frequent merge conflicts on the same artifact.
- Gandalf spends coordination time reconciling divergent edits.

**Remedy:** Assign exclusive file ownership in the Strategy of the Council. If two tasks must touch the same file, serialize them or split the file into independent modules first.
