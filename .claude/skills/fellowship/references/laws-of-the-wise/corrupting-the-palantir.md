# Law of the Wise: Corrupting the Palantir

Do not use the Palantir-bearer as a general-purpose task runner.

**Symptoms:**
- Palantir-bearer is assigned implementation tickets rather than review gates.
- Quality challenges stop appearing in Council of Elrond reports.
- Verification evidence comes from the same agent that wrote the code.

**Remedy:** Keep the Palantir-bearer exclusively on review, challenge, and validation duties. Never assign implementation tasks to the Palantir-bearer.
