# Law of the Wise: Straying from the Path

Do not allow tasks to expand scope beyond the original quest orders without re-scoping.

**Symptoms:**
- Quest Leaders add features or refactors not in the Strategy of the Council.
- Mission metric is no longer connected to active work.
- Token and time budgets overrun without corresponding mission progress.

**Remedy:** When scope drift is detected during a Council of Elrond Checkpoint, re-scope the task or split it. Work that falls outside the quest orders must be deferred or explicitly added with Gandalf's approval.
