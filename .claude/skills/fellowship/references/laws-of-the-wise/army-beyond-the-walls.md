# Army Beyond the Walls

**Rule:** Do not deploy allies for work that belongs to the Company's fellowship or warrants a new Company.

## Symptoms

- Quest Leader deploys allies constantly instead of using mustered companions.
- Ally objectives expand beyond single sorties.
- Allies editing files outside the Company's ownership.
- More allies deployed than companions mustered.

## Remedy

- Use **companions** for sub-tasks of the Company's deliverable.
- **Escalate to Gandalf** for sustained independent work that needs its own Company.
- Allies are for **focused sorties only** — quick recon, targeted fixes, one-shot tasks.

See `references/allies-of-the-free-peoples.md` for the deploy-or-escalate decision tree.
