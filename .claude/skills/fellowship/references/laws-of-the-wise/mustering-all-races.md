# Law of the Wise: Mustering All Races

Do not muster every role when the task does not require it.

**Symptoms:**
- Company musters 4 companions for a task that needs only a Gimli (Dwarf-Smith).
- Companions with no meaningful sub-task sit idle or invent busywork.
- Token budget burns on coordination overhead that exceeds the work itself.
- Quest Leader spends more time briefing and reviewing companions than the task warrants.

**Remedy:** Muster only the roles the task demands. Start with a Gimli (Dwarf-Smith) and add specialists only when there is a concrete sub-task that matches their role definition. Refer to the fellowship sizing table in `references/fellowship-roles.md`.
