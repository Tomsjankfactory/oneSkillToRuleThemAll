# Law of the Wise: Aragorn at the Anvil

The Quest Leader must not perform implementation work when companions are mustered.

**Symptoms:**
- Quest Leader writes code, edits files, or runs tests while companions are active.
- Companions sit idle waiting for direction while Quest Leader is heads-down on implementation.
- Company-level coordination breaks because Quest Leader is unavailable to review companion outputs.
- Sub-task blockers accumulate without resolution.

**Remedy:** Quest Leader must delegate all implementation to companions and stay focused on coordination: assigning sub-tasks, reviewing companion outputs, resolving blockers within the Company, and reporting progress to Gandalf.
