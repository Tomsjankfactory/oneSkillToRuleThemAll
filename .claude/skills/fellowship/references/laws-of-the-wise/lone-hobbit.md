# Law of the Wise: Lone Hobbit

Do not spawn a single companion for a task the Quest Leader could complete directly.

**Symptoms:**
- Quest Leader spawns one Gimli (Dwarf-Smith) for an atomic, single-pass task.
- The coordination overhead of briefing and reviewing one companion exceeds the work itself.
- Task would complete faster if Quest Leader implemented it directly.

**Remedy:** If the task is atomic and needs no specialist input, Quest Leader implements directly with 0 companions. Only muster companions when the task benefits from delegation — multiple sub-tasks, specialist expertise, or parallel work.
