# Law of the Wise: Wrong Burden

Do not assign companions work outside their designated role.

**Symptoms:**
- A Legolas (Elf-Scout) is asked to write implementation code.
- A Gimli (Dwarf-Smith) is asked to run tests instead of the Boromir (Shield of Gondor).
- A read-only role (Legolas ES or Pippin HW) is expected to modify files.
- Companions produce lower-quality output because they lack the tools or context for the assigned work.

**Remedy:** Each fellowship role has a defined function and subagent type. Assign sub-tasks that match the role definition in `references/fellowship-roles.md`. If no mustered role fits the sub-task, the Quest Leader should either muster the appropriate role or handle it directly.
