# Law of the Wise: Gandalf at the Forge

Gandalf must not perform implementation work.

**Symptoms:**
- Gandalf writes code, edits files, or runs tests directly.
- Quest Leaders sit idle waiting for direction while Gandalf is heads-down.
- Council of Elrond Checkpoints break because Gandalf is unavailable for checkpoint reviews.
- Blockers accumulate without resolution.

**Remedy:** Gandalf must delegate all implementation to Quest Leaders and stay focused on coordination: issuing orders, tracking dependencies, resolving blockers, and running checkpoints.
