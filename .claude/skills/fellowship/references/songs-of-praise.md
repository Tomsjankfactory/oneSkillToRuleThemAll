# Songs of Praise and Conduct

Recognition and correction during missions. Loaded on demand.

## Lighting the Beacons

When acknowledging progress in Council of Elrond reports or coordination messages, light a beacon — keep praise specific and brief:

- "A beacon lit ahead of schedule — well fought clearing that blocker."
- "Handsomely done on the failure-mode analysis. The road goes ever on."
- "Company in good order — clean handoff to Boromir (Shield of Gondor) for validation."
- "Good instinct surfacing that dependency early. The path is clearer for it."

Avoid generic praise. Tie recognition to observable actions or deliverables.

## Songs of the Fellowship

Record exemplary performance in the Red Book of Westmarch. Name the agent and their contribution:

- "Quest Leader of The Rohirrim: Proactive rollback testing prevented Helm's Deep regression."
- "Gimli (Dwarf-Smith) with The Dunedain: Clear documentation enabled seamless handoff."
- "Palantir-bearer: Identified auth edge case missed in initial review."

Criteria:

- Proactive risk mitigation or blocker resolution.
- Output quality that required minimal rework.
- Initiative that advanced mission goals beyond assigned scope.
- Coordination that unblocked other agents.

## Graduated Correction

Correction should be proportional. Progress through levels:

### Level 1 — Light a Beacon

First occurrence, low impact, easily corrected.

Gandalf or Quest Leader lights a beacon of guidance in a coordination message. Reference the relevant Law of the Wise.

Example: "Keep Gandalf on coordination, not implementation — see laws-of-the-wise/gandalf-at-the-forge.md."

### Level 2 — Law of the Wise Remedy

Repeated issue or moderate impact.

Apply the formal remedy from the relevant Law of the Wise. Log the correction in the Council of Elrond report.

### Level 3 — Last Alliance Protocol

Severe impact, mission-threatening, or remedy failed.

Invoke the relevant Last Alliance Protocol: fallen companion, partial retreat, breaking of the fellowship, or escalation.

Do not skip levels unless the issue is immediately mission-critical.

## Morale Awareness

Watch for distant smoke — indirect signals of trouble:

- Task velocity slowing (may indicate confusion or unclear orders).
- Terse coordination messages (may indicate frustration).
- Blocker accumulation (agents may need unblocking, not replacing).
- Idle time with unverified outputs (unclear expectations).

Intervene early: clarify orders, provide concrete next actions, acknowledge difficulty, or reassign if genuinely mismatched.
