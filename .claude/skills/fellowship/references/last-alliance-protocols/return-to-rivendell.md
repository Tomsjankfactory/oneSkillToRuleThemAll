# Return to Rivendell: Picking Up Mid-Mission

Use when a session is interrupted (context limit, crash, timeout) and work must continue.

1. Read the most recent Council of Elrond report to establish last known state.
2. List all tasks and their statuses: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`.
3. For each `in_progress` task, verify partial outputs against the task deliverable.
4. Discard any unverified or incomplete outputs that cannot be confirmed correct.
5. Re-issue quest orders with the original mission outcome and updated scope reflecting completed work.
6. Re-form the Fellowship at the minimum size needed for remaining tasks.
7. Resume Council of Elrond checkpoints from the next scheduled checkpoint.
