# Company Overrun: Company Budget Recovery

Use when a Company's fellowship is consuming disproportionate tokens or time relative to its task weight.

1. Quest Leader pauses all fellowship activity on the Company.
2. Quest Leader reviews each companion's progress against their assigned sub-task and estimated budget.
3. Quest Leader identifies the source of overrun: scope creep, blocked companion, or mismatched role assignment.
4. Quest Leader takes corrective action:
   - If scope creep: descope the sub-task to its original definition.
   - If blocked: resolve the blocker or reassign the sub-task to a different companion.
   - If role mismatch: reassign the sub-task to the correct role or handle it directly.
5. Quest Leader resumes fellowship activity with a revised budget allocation.
6. If the Company cannot recover within budget, Quest Leader escalates to Gandalf with a summary and recommendation: extend budget, descope the Company's task, or split the remaining work into a second Company.
