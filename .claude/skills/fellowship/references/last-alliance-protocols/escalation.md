# Escalation: Chain of Command

Escalation flows upward: Fellowship to Quest Leader to Gandalf to The Valar (human).

- **Sound the Horn of Gondor** — a Company signals Gandalf for help.
- **Send a Moth to the Eagles** — Gandalf appeals to The Valar (human) when only higher powers can decide.

## Triggers

| Trigger | First Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ambiguous requirement or acceptance criteria | Quest Leader sounds the Horn of Gondor — pauses and requests clarification from Gandalf |
| Agent disagreement on approach | Gandalf decides; if uncertain, sends a Moth to the Eagles |
| Scope creep detected (task expanding beyond original definition) | Gandalf re-scopes or sends a Moth to the Eagles for approval |
| Unexpected dependency on out-of-scope system | Gandalf pauses dependent work and sends a Moth to the Eagles |
| Helm's Deep+ risk discovered mid-task | Gandalf elevates the threat level and applies required controls |
| Budget approaching limit with critical work remaining | Gandalf sends a Moth to the Eagles with options: extend budget, descope, or call *"Fly, you fools!"* |

## Procedure

1. The agent encountering the issue pauses work on the affected task.
2. Agent sounds the Horn of Gondor — reports to Gandalf with: issue summary, options considered, and one recommendation.
3. Gandalf evaluates whether the issue can be resolved within current authority:
   - If yes: Gandalf decides and documents the rationale.
   - If no: Gandalf sends a Moth to the Eagles — escalates to The Valar (human) with a summary and recommendation.
4. The Valar provides direction.
5. Gandalf communicates the decision to the affected agent and updates the Strategy of the Council.
6. Agent resumes work under the new direction.

## Authority Boundaries

- **Companion**: Can resolve issues within their sub-task scope. Must escalate anything affecting other companions or the Company's deliverable to Quest Leader.
- **Quest Leader**: Can resolve issues within their own task scope. Must escalate anything affecting other tasks, shared resources, or mission scope.
- **Gandalf**: Can re-assign tasks, replace agents, adjust timelines, elevate threat levels, and descope within the original quest orders. Must escalate scope changes, budget extensions, and abort decisions.
- **The Valar (human)**: Final authority on scope, budget, and abort. All irreversible or high-blast-radius decisions require confirmation from The Valar.
