# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

TheFellowship -- a Lord of the Rings-themed multi-agent coordination skill for Claude Code, adapted from the [Nelson skill](https://github.com/harrymunro/nelson). Nelson uses Royal Navy metaphors (Admiral, Captains, Crew, Ships) to orchestrate parallel agent teams. TheFellowship replaces every naval concept with a Middle-earth equivalent while preserving all operational logic, decision trees, governance rules, and templates exactly.

Invoked with `$gandalf`.

## Source Reference

Every file in this skill maps 1:1 to a Nelson file. When implementing, fetch the Nelson source from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harrymunro/nelson/main/` and re-theme it. Do not invent new operational logic -- only change terminology.

## Character-to-Role Mapping

### Three-Tier Hierarchy

| Tier | Nelson | Fellowship | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategic Coordinator | Admiral | The White Council | **Gandalf** -- delegates, tracks, never implements |
| Tactical Commander | Captain | Quest Leader | **Aragorn** (primary), any member elevated to lead a Company |
| Human Authority | Admiralty | The Valar | The human operator -- final say on scope/budget/abort |

### Seven Fellowship Roles (replace 7 Navy Crew)

| # | Nelson Role | Fellowship Character | Abbr | Function | subagent_type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Executive Officer (XO) | Aragorn (Ranger-King) | RK | Integration & orchestration | general-purpose |
| 2 | Principal Warfare Officer (PWO) | Gimli (Dwarf-Smith) | DS | Core implementation | general-purpose |
| 3 | Navigating Officer (NO) | Legolas (Elf-Scout) | ES | Codebase research | Explore (read-only) |
| 4 | Marine Engineering Officer (MEO) | Boromir (Shield of Gondor) | SG | Testing & validation | general-purpose |
| 5 | Weapon Engineering Officer (WEO) | Sam (Hobbit-Gardener) | HG | Config, infrastructure | general-purpose |
| 6 | Logistics Officer (LOGO) | Merry (Hobbit-Strategist) | HS | Documentation & deps | general-purpose |
| 7 | Coxswain (COX) | Pippin (Hobbit-Watcher) | HW | Standards review & quality | Explore (read-only) |

### Special Roles

- **Red-Cell Navigator** -> **Palantir-bearer** -- adversarial reviewer, challenges assumptions
- **Frodo** -> Not an agent. Represents the critical deliverable / mission objective itself ("the Ring that must reach Mount Doom")

### Temporary Sub-Agents (replace Royal Marines -> Allies of the Free Peoples)

| Nelson Marine | Fellowship Ally | subagent_type | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recce Marine | Ranger of the North | Explore (read-only) | Scout unfamiliar code |
| Assault Marine | Rider of Rohan | general-purpose | Targeted fix, unblock |
| Sapper | Ent of Fangorn | general-purpose | Config, build, infra |

### Threat Levels (replace Action Stations)

| Nelson | Fellowship | Quote | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Station 0: Patrol | The Shire | *"...still there is much that is fair."* | Low -- internal renames, comments |
| Station 1: Caution | Weathertop | *"Something draws near. I can feel it."* | Moderate -- user-facing, coupled |
| Station 2: Action | Helm's Deep | *"So it begins."* | High -- security, compliance |
| Station 3: Trafalgar | The Crack of Doom | *"Cast it into the fire! Destroy it!"* | Critical -- irreversible, needs human confirmation |

## Concept Mapping (Naming Glossary)

| Nelson | Fellowship |
|---|---|
| Squadron | The Fellowship |
| Ship | Company (named after Middle-earth peoples) |
| Sailing Orders | The Quest |
| Battle Plan | Strategy of the Council |
| Quarterdeck Rhythm | Council of Elrond Checkpoints |
| Captain's Log | Red Book of Westmarch |
| Standing Orders | Laws of the Wise |
| Damage Control | Last Alliance Protocols |
| Royal Marines | Allies of the Free Peoples |
| Commendations | Songs of Praise |
| Signal Flags | Lighting the Beacons |

### Company Names (replace Ship Names, organized by task weight)

Companies are named after the peoples and forces of Middle-earth, not locations -- peoples act, places don't.

- **Patrols** (small tasks): Bombadil's Folk, The Bree-folk, The Lake-men, Beorn's Folk, The Shire-muster
- **War-bands** (general tasks): The Dunedain, The Rohirrim, The Men of Dale, The Beornings, The Green Elves, The Woodmen, The Wildermen, The Drúedain
- **Hosts** (high-tempo/high-risk): The Galadhrim, The Guard of the Citadel, The Dwarves of Erebor, The Ents of Fangorn, The Host of the Mark, The Swan Knights
- **Grand Alliances** (critical-path): The White Council, The Last Alliance, The Grey Company, The Vanguard of the King
- **Shadow-walkers** (research/stealth): The Rangers of Ithilien, The Watchers in the Wood, The Pathfinders of Arnor, The Dead of Dunharrow

```

## Usage

Invoke the skill with `$gandalf` followed by a quest description:

```
$gandalf Refactor the authentication module to use JWT tokens
```

Gandalf will:
1. **Declare the Quest** -- define outcome, metric, deadline, constraints
2. **Form the Fellowship** -- select mode (single-session/subagents/agent-team), size the team, assign Company names
3. **Hold the Council** -- break the quest into tasks with owners, deliverables, dependencies, and threat levels
4. **Run Council of Elrond Checkpoints** -- periodic progress reviews, blocker resolution, budget tracking
5. **Assess the Threat** -- apply threat-level controls (The Shire / Weathertop / Helm's Deep / The Crack of Doom)
6. **Return to the Shire** -- archive sessions, produce a Red Book of Westmarch entry

### Governance Limits

- Fellowship cap: 10 agents (1 Gandalf + up to 9 Quest Leaders/Palantir-bearer)
- Max 4 companions per Company
- Max 2 allies (temporary sub-agents) per Company
- Helm's Deep+ ally deployments require Gandalf approval
- Crack of Doom tasks require explicit human (Valar) confirmation

## Verification Checklist

1. `$gandalf` invocation discovers the skill (agent `name` in frontmatter matches skill `name`)
2. All file cross-references in SKILL.md resolve to actual files
3. File count: 33 total (1 agent + 1 SKILL + 5 references + 8 templates + 12 laws + 6 protocols)
4. Operational rules preserved: team cap 10, max 4 per Company, max 2 allies, threat-level decision tree
5. Read-only roles (Legolas ES, Pippin HW) use `Explore` subagent_type; all others use `general-purpose`

## Key Design Decisions

- **Gandalf as Admiral** -- never fights when he can guide; coordinates, inspires, intervenes only at crisis
- **The Valar as human authority** -- highest powers in Tolkien's cosmology, rarely intervene but hold ultimate authority
- **Frodo is not an agent** -- represents the critical deliverable itself, the thing that must be carried to completion
- **Palantir-bearer (not a named character)** -- the seeing-stone concept for adversarial review, avoiding negative connotations of Saruman/Denethor who misused Palantiri
- **Companies named after peoples** -- peoples act, places don't; The Grey Company for critical-path, Bombadil's Folk for small tasks, The Galadhrim for high-risk
- **"Laws of the Wise"** -- Istari and Elven lords had codified knowledge about governance and restraint
- **"Last Alliance"** -- the desperate coalition formed when things went badly wrong, maps perfectly to recovery procedures
